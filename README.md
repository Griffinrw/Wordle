## Description

Play the popular New York Times' game Wordle as much as you want!

This Python script was created by reverse-engineering Wordle, with the caveat that it allows you to replay it forever.

It uses the exact word list from Wordle as well, so you know it's an authentic experience (albeit frustrating).
