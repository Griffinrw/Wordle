# Wordle
Python version of the popular New York Times Wordle game. Based off of https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

You will need Termcolor for this to work properly. Either install it with "pip install termcolor", or download it from their website here: https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/

Has infinite replayability unlike the New York Times version.

Plays completely in your cmd prompt without needing access to the internet.
